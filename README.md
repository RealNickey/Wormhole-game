## 🚀 TL;DR  
*Ever wanted to blast wireframe boxes while careening through an infinite red tube in space? No? Well, NOW YOU CAN ANYWAY!*

## 🤔 What Actually Is This?

Welcome to the **Wormhole Tunnel Rage Simulator** the game nobody asked for but everybody secretly needed. This is a THREE.js-powered space shooter where you're inexplicably trapped in an eternal crimson wormhole, armed with nothing but golden lasers and an existential need to destroy rainbow-colored wireframe cubes.

**The Setup:** You're flying through a looping red tube tunnel in space at a constant speed (because brakes are for cowards). Your mission? Click frantically to shoot glowing laser bolts at randomly-scattered wireframe boxes that are just... floating there. Why are they there? We don't know. Why do they explode into satisfying bloom effects? WHO CARES—IT LOOKS COOL!

**Who's it for?**
- Developers learning THREE.js who need a dopamine hit(aka me)
- Anyone with 5 minutes to kill and a mouse
- Fans of tubes, lasers, and questionable physics

## 🛠️ Features

- **🌈 255 Wireframe Boxes of Doom** - Because 254 just wasn't enough chaos
- **💥 Golden Laser Bolts** - Pew pew! (Sound effects sold separately—actually not included at all)
- **🎯 Crosshair That Actually Follows Your Mouse** - Revolutionary technology from 1993
- **✨ UnrealBloomPass Post-Processing** - Making everything look 300% more dramatic than it needs to be
- **🌟 500 Procedurally-Generated Stars** - Each one completely indifferent to your struggle
- **🔴 Infinite Red Tube Prison** - You can't escape. Don't even try. It loops forever.
- **📏 Spline-Based Path** - 39 hardcoded coordinates that definitely weren't just randomly placed
- **🎨 HSL Color Gradient** - Boxes change color based on position because SCIENCE
- **💀 Hit Detection** - Boxes actually disappear when you shoot them (revolutionary, we know)
- **🖱️ Mouse-Controlled Aiming** - Move your mouse. Aim. Click. Repeat until existential crisis.
- **📱 Responsive Design** - Works on any screen size (tunnel of despair scales accordingly)

## 🧑‍💻 How To Install?

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (because nothing runs directly in browsers anymore)
- A mouse (touchpads are for masochists)
- 5 minutes of your life you'll never get back
- Low standards for entertainment

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone this bad boy:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RealNickey/Wormhole-game.git
   cd Wormhole-game
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (aka download half of npm):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   *Or if you're old-school:*
   ```bash
   npx vite
   ```

4. **Open your browser** to whatever localhost port Vite spits out (probably `http://localhost:5173`)

5. **Embrace the tube.** Let it consume you. You are one with the wormhole now.

## 🎮 How To Play?

1. **Look at the screen** - Red tube. Colorful boxes. Space stuff. Got it? Good.
2. **Move your mouse** - The white crosshair follows you like a loyal puppy
3. **Click to shoot** - Golden lasers go brrrrr
4. **Hit the boxes** - They explode in a glorious bloom of light
5. **Keep shooting** - There's no objective. There's no score. There's only THE VOID.
6. **Experience existential dread** - As you realize the tunnel loops forever and the boxes respawn never
